Why does the layout of DeDop Studio looks different in my computer?
====================================================================

DeDop Studio was designed at a window size of 1366 x 768, which is at the moment the most common laptop screen resolution.
This means that all the component placements were decided based on what looks best at 1366 x 768 resolution. Panel placements
may be different in lower resolution, but they should all still be fully functional. Please drop us a message if your
experience is greatly affected by this.
